# Stock Management using BST

Stock Management using BST is a project designed to help businesses manage their inventory using a binary search tree (BST) data structure. The program allows users to add, delete, and search for items in their inventory.

The BST structure ensures that items are sorted in a specific order, making it easier to search for and retrieve data. This means that users can quickly find the information they need, without having to sort through large amounts of data manually.

The project includes a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the program in a straightforward manner. Users can add new items to their inventory by entering information such as the item name, price, and quantity. They can also update existing items and remove items that are no longer in stock.

The program includes additional features such as the ability to generate reports on inventory levels, sales, and profits. These reports can help businesses make informed decisions about their inventory and sales strategies.

Overall, Stock Management using BST is a powerful tool for businesses looking to streamline their inventory management process. By using a BST data structure, the program ensures that inventory data is organized and easily accessible, making it easier for businesses to make informed decisions about their stock levels and sales strategies.

A detailed stock report is generated using file handling in Python to manage stock available.
